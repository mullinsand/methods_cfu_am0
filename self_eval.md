# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  - I feel pretty confident. I need to internalize more of the methods and get a feel for the patterns that arise. Overall, I love expanding my abilities to do things in ruby and is a real driver to understand it all.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
  - I am confident I can pull it off. I need a little more practice to really have it down, but can muddle through most problems already.1
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
  - I have many questions about the nomenclature around methods. What is the difference between explicit and implicit return? What exactly is a return value? Is the return value always nil if the last line starts with puts? I think I need to read more about how to discuss this in proper programmer english. The Methods live session doesn't have the best examples in it and I wish that more time was spent on how to properly communicate what is going on. I can write the code easy, but talking about it in a way another programmer would be able to follow along is a long way off.
